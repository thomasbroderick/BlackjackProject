## Blackjack Project

### Overview
This is a Blackjack simulator. The program uses Objects for Card, Deck, Hand, and a game of Blackjack.  The game engine deals cards to the player and the dealer and then allows the player to make a Hit or Stand decision if they have not already won (or lost) due to a Blackjack. This project was completed after week 3 of the Skill Distillery boot camp.
